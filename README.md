# Nerd4Lyfe's IITC Plugins

This is my collection of plugins for the IITC framework for the game Ingress. Most of these are written by me, some are tweaked or modded but all are useful!

* [Show uncaptured portal's last activity date/age on map](https://github.com/seattletechie/iitc-plugins/wiki/iitc-plugin:-Show-inactive-age-on-map) - This will create a new layer which when enabled will overlay inactive portal's last activity date and number of days it's  been unclaimed on the map by the portal. Similar to (and conflicts with visually for now) the Portal Names plugin. Turn off the portal names layer to prevent the conflict.
